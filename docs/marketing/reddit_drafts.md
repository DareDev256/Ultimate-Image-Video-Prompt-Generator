# Reddit Launch Post Drafts

Here are a few variations for your launch post.

## Option 1: The "Nostalgia" Hook (Best for r/webdev, r/SideProject)

**Title:** I built an AI Prompt Generator that looks like a 2004 Flash website (Next.js + Framer Motion)

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

I missed the early 2000s "Flash Era"—when websites were theatrical experiences with loading bars, glossy buttons, and over-the-top sound effects.

So I built **Ultimate Image & Prompt Generator** to bring that vibe back, but using modern tech.

**What it does:**
It's a step-by-step wizard to build complex AI prompts (Subject, Lighting, Camera, Film Stock, etc.) and generate them using Gemini, DALL-E 3, or Kling (for video).

**The Tech Stack:**

* **Next.js 16** (App Router)
* **Tailwind CSS v4** (for the glossy styling)
* **Framer Motion** (for the "Flash-like" transitions and particle effects)
* **Privacy:** It's BYOK (Bring Your Own Key), so everything stays in your browser.

It was a fun challenge to recreate those "premium" Flash animations using just CSS and JS.

Would love to hear what you think of the design!

## Option 2: The "Problem Solver" Hook (Best for r/ArtificialInteligence, r/OpenAI)

**Title:** I got tired of guessing prompt parameters, so I built a visual wizard to do it for me.

**Body:**
I wanted more control over my AI images (lighting, camera angles, film stocks) without memorizing valid parameters for every model.

I built a tool that guides you through 9 categories (Subject, Style, Mood, etc.) to assemble the perfect prompt. It works with Gemini, DALL-E 3, and Kling.

**Key Features:**

* **Structured Prompts:** Generates JSON for Gemini or optimized natural language for DALL-E.
* **Visual Wizard:** Click-to-select parameters instead of typing blindly.
* **No backend:** Runs entirely in the browser (BYOK).
